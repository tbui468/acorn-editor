Todo after done with tutorial
    Should convert all tabs to spaces - this will simplify code by a bit
        eg, get rid of render_x and just use cursor_x.
        do this after entire editor tutorial is done, and make sure to save it to version control before changing it
    Change theme to Oblivion/80s sci fi theme
    Add vim style navigation (start with adding Insert/Command modes and allow navigation with hjkl)
    Add tabs / multiple buffers (display filename or tab number on top) - this is easier than vim's :ls every time to see buffers
    Add network support to allow two people to edit file at the same time (super advanced stuff)
        one person (main) would open the file, and the other person connects to the open file
        the main has the ability to write to file (read is allowed for everyone connected)
    Add syntax highighting for Cebra scripting language (or Python or Lua)

Todo anytime
    Change EditorConfig variables screenrows and screencols to screen_rows and screen_cols for consistency
    Rename EditorConfig.row to EditorConfig.rows (since it's a point/array into all the rows)
    Weird bug when pressing 'Enter' when cursor is on first line of file
