Todo after done with tutorial
    Should convert all tabs to spaces - this will simplify code by a bit
        eg, get rid of render_x and just use cursor_x.
        do this after entire editor tutorial is done, and make sure to save it to version control before changing it
    Change theme to Oblivion/80s sci fi theme
    Add vim style insert and command modes

Todo anytime
    Change EditorConfig variables screenrows and screencols to screen_rows and screen_cols for consistency
    Rename EditorConfig.row to EditorConfig.rows (since it's a point/array into all the rows)
